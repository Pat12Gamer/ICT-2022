            <h4>What is cyberbullying?</h4>
            <p>Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include:</p>
            <div class="lol">
                <ul>
                    <li>spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos or videos of someone on social media</li>
                    <li>sending hurtful, abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging platforms</li>
                    <li>impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf or through fake accounts.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint â€“ a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.</p>
